* DONE Giant enemy boss graphics
* DONE Enemy has turrets that fire at my ships
** DONE Area of effect explosions
* DONE Click to raycast a point and cause nearby ships to jump it
** DONE Figure out mouse cursor raycast: Either click on any enemy assets, or the background
** DONE Boost your ships to the target position - Up to 200 ships
** DONE Only X distance away from target
** DONE If nobody in range, mark the action as invalid
* DONE Small plasma gun turrets. Without any smart tracking
* TODO Make a playable gameplay
** DONE Damage on DeathStar if ship reaches it. Otherwise kill if Z is too high
*** DONE Show gradualDamage using a texture to draw on maybe
** DONE Shield of DeathStar tanks many hits
** DONE Need These for balance:
*** DONE Turrets fire faster and turn much faster the more you click to use
** DONE Enemy launches large ships to go in front of it and fire.
*** DONE Five-barreled killing machine
*** DONE An agile laser frigate.
**** DONE Just snaps laser on nearby enemy directly. No projectile
*** DONE Can only boost if Z > 10 or so
*** DONE Boosted will target and directly kamikaze any nearby Frigate
*** DONE 400 smallships can kill frigate it if collided on
** DONE Screen flash when kill Frigate
** DONE Some smallships are impatient, they fly very fast temporarily until reaching z=22 (in view?)
** DONE Kamikaze should work automatically on deathstar (it's already the case :-) )
** DONE Make mouse visible always on screen
** DONE Make cooldown for boost ability
*** DONE Also show ability cooldown on cursor
** DONE Frigates explode after a delay
** TODO Limit spawning of small ships to max 30,000 concurrent ships
** TODO Some 0.1 of the small ships can fire tiny tiny bullets if far enough Z level
*** TODO Show tracer lines visuals. NO collision or quadrants!
*** TODO They do very small damage when arriving to DeathStar. Can't pierce the whole shields by themselves
*** TODO Also they can't do any hull damage
** TODO Also make kamikaze mechanism work on Turrets
** TODO Healthbars for large turrets and frigates - I have ECS idea for this
** TODO Think about a second ability to have maybe? Or maybe not needed
*** TODO Maybe if smallships are too far back, a boost click instead JUMPS the nearest upto 400 ships
**** TODO The ships JUMP forward as if hyperspace, screen flashes slightly as well to hide it
** TODO Maybe graphic for all these new features????
** TODO Think about endgame options thing
*** TODO Maybe an extra  giant weapon on the deathstar, very rarely activated
**** TODO Some huge long ray beam
**** TODO The ray kills EVERYTHING in its path
** TODO Final gameplay:
Destroy all turrets. Destroy all frigates as they come.
Do this so you can mass ships on the screen.
Many ships = many bullets. With enough bullets you can pierce base shields completely.
And then the kamikaze can blow it up
Shows casualty score "Ships lost" - win with the fewest ships destroyed to be the best person ever to exist
* TODO Nice for fun and visuals and stuff
** TODO Screen shakes more and more the more that things die from DEATH TAG
** TODO Maybe some animation of Deathstar to rotate. Both it and the ECS version of it
** TODO Boss rotates and animates
*** TODO Different sections of the boss rotate differently
** TODO Fix the calculations of nearest ships to recruit
** TODO Fix Letterbox Camera to not waste so much performance!?!?!!?!??!
